# School District Analysis
Analysis done using Python on Jupyter Notebook involving Panda Dataframes.
## Overview of the school district analysis.
The purpose of the original analysis was to analyze the school and students data to see the performance of students and schools in reading and maths on a district level. Performance was also calculated for each grade level, for groups of school size and types and also by spending budget per student. The challenge tasked us to review the data due to academic dishonesty for 9th Grade students in Thomas High School for both reading and maths. To  uphold state-testing standards, the said results were changed to NaNs while the rest of the data remained intact. After replacing the data, the school district analysis was performed again. The results are explained below.
